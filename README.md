The Code is used to perform data analysis on three different datasets: marketing_monthly_data, transaction_details_data, and transaction_monthly_data. The code imports required libraries, downloads the datasets from Google Drive, reads the datasets into Pandas dataframes, and performs some data cleaning and pre-processing steps such as converting certain columns into the datetime format and filtering the data to only consider certain columns and transactions. After the data cleaning and pre-processing steps, the code combines the two datasets based on the user_id column and performs a sanity check to ensure that the number of users in the transaction details dataset is identical to the number of users in the combined data frame. The code also filters out transactions that are not "COMPLETED".
